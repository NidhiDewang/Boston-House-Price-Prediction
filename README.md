# Boston-House-Price-Prediction

Situation:
Predicting housing prices accurately is crucial for various stakeholders, including buyers, sellers, and real estate agents. The Boston Housing dataset provides an excellent opportunity to develop predictive models based on various features such as crime rate, number of rooms, and accessibility to highways. Machine learning techniques can leverage these features to forecast housing prices and inform decision-making in the real estate market.

Task:
The task is to develop predictive models for Boston house prices using three machine learning algorithms: linear regression, random forest, and support vector machine (SVM). These models will utilize features from the Boston Housing dataset to predict the prices of houses in the Boston area accurately. The goal is to compare the performance of different algorithms and identify the most effective approach for house price prediction.

Action:

Data Collection: Obtain the Boston Housing dataset, which contains features such as crime rate, average number of rooms, and property tax rates, along with corresponding house prices.
Data Preprocessing: Clean the data, handle missing values, and normalize or scale the features to ensure compatibility with the machine learning algorithms.
Model Development: Implement linear regression, random forest, and SVM models using appropriate libraries or frameworks. Experiment with different hyperparameters and feature engineering techniques to optimize each model's performance.
Validation and Evaluation: Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Train each model on the training data and evaluate their performance using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared on the test data. Compare the performance of each algorithm to determine the most effective approach.

Result:
Linear Regression: Provides a simple and interpretable model for house price prediction, but may struggle to capture complex non-linear relationships between features and prices.
Random Forest: Offers robustness against overfitting and handles non-linear relationships well, resulting in improved prediction accuracy compared to linear regression.
Support Vector Machine (SVM): Effective in capturing complex decision boundaries and handling high-dimensional data, but may require careful tuning of hyperparameters and kernel selection.
Outcome:

The Boston House Price Prediction project using multiple machine learning algorithms enables stakeholders in the real estate market to make informed decisions about buying and selling properties in the Boston area. By comparing the performance of linear regression, random forest, and SVM models, the project helps stakeholders understand the strengths and limitations of each approach and select the most suitable method based on their specific requirements and preferences. Ultimately, the project contributes to enhancing transparency and efficiency in the real estate market, leading to more accurate pricing and better outcomes for buyers and sellers alike.
